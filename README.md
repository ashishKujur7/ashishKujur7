## All About Ashish
Hello, there! I am Ashish Kujur. I am currently a MSc Mathematics student as [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/). When I am not doing Maths, you can find me dabbling with free and open source softwares and my guitar. 

I primarily created this Github remote to upload lecture notes that I take in class. You can reach me on e-mail: [ashish.kujur@protonmail.com](mailto:ashish.kujur@protonmail.com).
