## All About Ashish
Hello, there! I am Ashish Kujur. I am currently a MSc Mathematics student as [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/). When I am not doing Maths, you can find me dabbling with free and open source softwares and my guitar. 

I primarily created this Github remote to upload lecture notes that I take in class and solutions to some problems that I solve. You can reach me on my e-mail: [ashish.kujur@protonmail.com](mailto:ashish.kujur@protonmail.com). 

In case, you're curious: I use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [Vim-LaTeX](http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/) plugin, [TexLive distribution](https://tug.org/texlive/) and [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) to typeset these notes. I did not have hunt them down on the web as they are [free and open source softwares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and available in repositories of most (I suspect all!) Linux distributions. [BTW I use Debian](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/btw-i-use-arch).

Here's one of favourite quotes:
> "The beauty of mathematics only shows itself to more patient followers."

> â€” Maryam Mirzakhani
