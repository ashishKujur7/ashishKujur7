## All About Ashish
Hello, there! I am Ashish Kujur. I am currently a MSc Mathematics student as Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram. Besides Maths, I am quite interested in free and open source softwares and can play the guitar quite a bit. 

I mainly created this Github remote to upload lecture notes that I take in class. You can reach me on e-mail: [ashish.kujur@protonmail.com](mailto:ashish.kujur@protonmail.com).
