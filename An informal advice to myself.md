# An informal mathematical advice to myself

1. **Take Notes!**
Most teachers do not have much time to convey everything. They try to rush the information in whatever short amount of time they get. It does not matter if you do not understand whatever the teacher says. Just go to the class and take down whatever information the instructor has to offer. *The real learning happens outside the class*. An hour worth of lecture is worth three times worth of self study time! This is no exaggeration for teachers expect you to fill in whatever little details that can possibly be filled. 

2. **Do the assignment and do it early.**
Slacking off is not an excuse. Some questions on the quiz and/or the final examination are a variant of the questions on the assigments. Not only that, you actually get to test if you are "actually" learning the material that you are learning.
If you postpone doing your assignments to the very last minute, you miss out on a lot of things. First, you do not get to write down your proper solutions and writing down is a important part of learning mathematics. If you put something down on paper, people can critique your solutions and you get feedback. 

3. **Study for the exam!**
Speaking from personal experience, I like to mathematics but I do not like studying for exams. Studying for several subjects and revising everything is quite stressful. Do not let this tire you out. Revise whatever theory is needed for the exam/quiz, revisit the assignment problems that were given and do some extra problems from the textbook.

4. **Form study groups.**
Mathematics is learnt best when you discuss with other people. You get to explain what you learnt and you learn whatever they have got to offer. 

5. **Talk to your professor!**
Interaction never hurts. Also, it gets you a good letter of recommendation if they know that you actually care about mathematics.

6. **Revise!**
Redoing homework helps (if you have got time).

7. **Read mathematics books.**
Besides the instructor, books are your best source of information. Different authors have different expository style, so, do not get lost in flipping too many books. If the author is using a particular textbook for the course, use that particular textbook.  Also, textbooks are a good source of problems. Try working on those. Once the course is over, books can be used to relearn the stuff that you missed out and something that course did not have to offer.

8. **Take breaks often!**
Mathematics is more exhausting than running 5 kms. So take breaks! Use the pomodoro method. I personally have tried it and it has enabled me to study for long time with burning out myself. I repeat 40min work - 10 min break four times and a take long break of 20 minutes. I personally like to walk and listen to music in my breaks. No one is actually stopping from doing anything in your breaks, so, do whatever the f*** you want.

9. **Have a good night sleep.**
A goodnight sleeps helps you to think better and which is required for doing mathematics.

10. **Enjoy life, please!**
There's more to life than mathematics. A all-round development is very important than just being a study bug.
